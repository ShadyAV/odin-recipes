<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It is is a dish of skewered and grilled cubes of meat, similar to or synonymous <br>
    with shish kebab. It is known traditionally by various other names in Iran, the Caucasus, <br>
    Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and from the 19th century became popular <br>
    as shashlik across much of the Russian Empire and nowadays in the <br>
    Russian Federation and former Soviet republics. <br>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>li 2 kg lamb cut into 2" cubes (shoulder or leg)</li>
    <li>4 bay leaves ripped in half</li>
    <li>4 medium onions sliced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tbs oil</li>
    <li>1-Â½ cups of water Borjomi Mineral Water</li>
    <li>hot paprika powder optional</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the lamb, sliced onions, bay leaves, <br>
        salt, oil and water. Using your hands, mix them all together <br>
        set aside in the fridge to marinate overnight. If in a hurry <br>
        then for minimum 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Thread the meat pieces onto metal skewers, about 6 per skewer, <br>
        with any fat positioned towards the outside of the skewer.</li>
    <li>Prepare the mangal. Place charcoals in the mangal, and light and <br>
        allow to burn for about 30 minutes, or until the charcoal is <br>
        all white. Your mangal is ready.</li>
    <li>Place the skewers on the mangal and cook until the meat is cooked. <br>
        The length of time is determined by the heat and height from the <br>
        charcoal. Don't burn your meat! Keep turning the shashlik as it cooks, <br>
        so it doesn't burn. I like to add hot paprika spice directly on the <br>
        skewer for a spicy kick.</li>
