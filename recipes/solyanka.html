<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Solyanka is a rich and hearty soup that is popular in Russia and Eastern Europe. <br>
    It's made with cured meats, green Gordal olives, pickles, veggies, and a flavorful <br>
    beef broth. The unusual ingredients blend together perfectly to create a soup that is irresistible.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>7 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
    <li>7 ounces kielbasa sausage, diced</li>
    <li>7 ounces salami, diced (see notes about meat)</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, minced</li>
    <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
    <li>1 large carrot, grated</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 cup Gordal olives, chopped</li>
    <li>3 pickles, chopped</li>
    <li>6 cups beef bone broth</li>
    <li>¼ cup pickle juice, from the pickle jar</li>
    <li>To serve: lemon slices, fresh dill, sour cream, extra Gordal or Manzanilla olives</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add the bacon to a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook until the bacon <br>
        has started to crisp and much of the fat is released. Add the kielbasa and <br>
        salami and continue to cook until the bacon is crispy and the meat has <br>
        browned. Remove the meat from the pot using a slotted spoon then drain all <br>
        but 2 tablespoons of the oil from the pot. </li>
    <li>Add the onion to the pot and cook until it is soft, about 5 minutes. Add the <br>
        celery and carrot and cook until both begin to soften, about 3 minutes. </li>
    <li>Push the veggies to the side of the pot then add the tomato paste. Spread it <br>
        out a little then let it caramelize for 3 minutes. Add the paprika and allspice <br>
        and mix everything together. </li>
    <li>Add the bay leaves, Gordal olives, pickles, beef bone broth, pickle juice, and the <br>
        cooked meat to the pot and bring the pot to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for <br>
        10 minutes. Taste the soup and add salt if needed - there are a lot of salty flavors <br>
        in this so you probably won't add extra salt. Remove the bay leaves.</li>
    <li>Serve the soup topped with a slice of lemon, some fresh dill, a spoonful of sour cream, <br>
        and a few extra Gordal olives. </li>
